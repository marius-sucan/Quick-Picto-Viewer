<p>QPV is an image viewer, editor and a tool to organize image collections based on the GDI+ and FreeImage libraries. It can open about 85 image file formats: .hdr, .raw, .tif, .emf, .wmf, .png, .bmp, .gif, .jpeg and many others.</p>

<h2><a href="https://marius.sucan.ro/media/files/blog/ahk-scripts/quick-picto-viewer-compiled.zip">Download latest version</a> (compiled for  Windows, as a x64 binary)</h2>

<p>QPV is able to create image slideshows and cache very large dynamic lists of files. Unlike other applications of this kind, it can load, on my system, a list of 900100 files in under 10 seconds, while XnView Classic or Irfan View need more than 15 minutes. The index of files can be saved as plain-text or as an SQLite database.</p>

<p>With Quick Picto Viewer you can generate file statistics over huge image libraries which can help identify very small images, very low key, or washed out images. You can also identify image duplicates and auto-select files by given criteria.</p>

<p>QPV also has specific tools to index image contents and identify image duplicates, based on similarity. Users can choose from four algorithms to identify the duplicates.</p>

<p>Quick Picto Viewer is also able to play sound files associated with images, automatically or on demand, and even generate slideshows that are in synch with the audio files duration. Supported audio formats: WAV, MP3 and WMA. It can also display image captions / notes for image.</p>

<p>Since Quick Picto Viewer v4, users can also edit images by using freely rotated elliptical or rectangular selections, or vector shapes. Common functions provided: paint brushes, paste in place, color adjustments, draw arcs, lines or shapes, insert text, soft edges blur area and so on.</p>

<p>QPV runs on Windows XP*, Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p>

<p>Source code available on <a href="https://github.com/marius-sucan/Quick-Picto-Viewer">Github</a>.</p>

<p><em>To run the uncompiled edition, download the ZIP file.</em> Required DLL files are included in the ZIP file, except for those needed to run on Windows XP.</p>

<p>Developed by <a href="http://marius.sucan.ro/">Marius Șucan</a> with special attention for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>I coded the application as an <a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AHK script</a> for AutoHotkey_H v1.1.32. To execute or compile the source code one needs AHK_H.<em>The required DLL files are found in the provided ZIP compiled script package</em>.</p>

<p>(*) Quick Picto Viewer can run on Windows XP, but various features might not work well. However, if you choose to do so, you must provide it with files found in Windows 10 (and possibly other Windows versions) installations. You must choose the ones that suit your Windows XP installation: DLLs for x32 or x64. These must be placed in the same folder with the QPV .EXE binary. The DLL files required are:</p>
<ul>
<li>api-ms-win-core-*-l1-1-0.dll [43 files]</li>
<li>api-ms-win-crt-*-l1-1-0.dll [15 files]</li>
<li>api-ms-win-core-file-l1-2-0.dll</li>
<li>api-ms-win-core-file-l2-1-0.dll</li>
<li>api-ms-win-core-localization-l1-2-0.dll</li>
<li>api-ms-win-core-synch-l1-2-0.dll</li>
<li>ucrtbase.dll</li>
