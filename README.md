<h1>Quick Picto Viewer</h1>

<h2>To keep the development going, <a href="https://www.paypal.me/MariusSucan/10">please donate</a> using PayPal.</h2>

<p>QPV is an image viewer, editor and a tool to organize image collections based on the GDI+ and FreeImage libraries. It can open about 85 image file formats: .hdr, .raw, .tif, .emf, .wmf, .png, .bmp, .gif, .jpeg and many others.</p>

<h2><a href="https://marius.sucan.ro/media/files/blog/ahk-scripts/quick-picto-viewer-compiled.zip">Download latest version</a> (compiled for  Windows, as a x64 binary)</h2>

<p>QPV is able to create image slideshows and cache very large dynamic lists of files. Unlike other applications of this kind, it can load, on my system, a list of 900100 files in under 10 seconds, while XnView Classic or Irfan View need more than 15 minutes. The index of files can be saved as plain-text or as an SQLite database.</p>

<p>With Quick Picto Viewer you can generate file statistics over huge image libraries which can help identify very small images, very low key, or washed out images. You can also identify image duplicates and auto-select files by given criteria.</p>

<p>QPV also has specific tools to index image contents and identify image duplicates, based on similarity. Users can choose from four algorithms to identify the duplicates.</p>

<p>Quick Picto Viewer is also able to play sound files associated with images, automatically or on demand, and even generate slideshows that are in synch with the audio files duration. Supported audio formats: WAV, MP3 and WMA. It can also display image captions / notes for image.</p>

<p>QPV can be used to edit images and/or paint new images. Various tools to this end are available, including blending modes and alpha masking abilities. Please see the features list to learn more in details what QPV can do.</p>

<H1>Other details</H1>
<p>Developed by <a href="http://marius.sucan.ro/">Marius Èucan</a> with special attention for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>I coded the application as an <a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AHK script</a> for AutoHotkey_H v1.1.32, [newer versions are not yet supported]. To execute or compile the source code one needs <a href="https://hotkeyit.github.io/v2/">AHK_H</a>.</p>

<p>Quick Picto Viewer can run on Windows 7 and even on XP, but various features might not work. To this end, you may have to copy all the DLL files found in the .\optional-DLL-files-x64\ folder to the same folder where the QPV binary is. If you are running it uncompiled, you must place them in the folder where the AutoHotkey binary resides. The required DLLs for x64 are bundled since version 5.7.5 in the ZIP package and can also be found in the Github repository.</p>
