IMAGE EDITING:
===========================

* Options to control viewport brightness, contrast, saturation and RGB color channels balance/intensity.

* Images can be rotated or mirrored horizontally and vertically in the viewport.

* Paint brushes: soft edges, cloner, eraser, pinch, bulge, smudge and more:
- ability to randomize various brush properties when painting
- textured brushes
- paint with symmetry

* Image editing tools: 
- draw arcs, lines and filled shapes
- parametric line generators [grids, spirals, rays and more]
- advanced flood fill [color bucket]
- insert text with advanced customization options
- paste in place
- transform selected area
- various blur filters: gaussian, box blur, radial blur and others
- rotate, crop, flip, pixelize, add noise, and more.

* Draw free-form Bézier curved paths or polygonal lines; options to fill with color, textures or gradients.

* Free-form curved or polygonal selections, elliptical and rectangular selections, rotated at any angle.

* Vector shapes can be defined with symmetry on X or Y axis.

* Ability to save/load user created vector paths.

* 18 blending modes and alpha masking support implemented for various image editing tools.

* Alpha mask can be user painted or generated: a gradient [linear, box, radial] or a previously drawn vector path.

* Advanced yet easy to use auto-crop for images.

* Real-time histogram for any image color channel of the image displayed.

* Easy to configure viewport grid.

* Paste texts from clipboard and render them as images. Text and background colors, font style, alignment and size can be personalized.

* Copy / paste image to / from clipboard with the alpha channel preserved. 

* Print image. Users can add text, adjust size and position on the page before printing.

* Batch printing of multiple images.

* Acquire images from scanners.

* Resize and crop images preserving the alpha-channel on save.

* Multiple file formats supported for saving an image.


FILES MANAGEMENT:
===========================

* Omnibox and folders tree view - two specialized panels meant to help users navigate through folders, with support for drag and drop amongst them.

* Quick file actions. Easily move or copy files to user defined folder paths using the number keys: 1 to 6.

* Ability to automatically group files into sub-folders based on file types or modification date, by months or years.

* Tool to copy or move files by maintaining their folder(s) structure

* Create PDFs or multi-paged TIFFs from selected images. Up to 2048 images allowed.

* Extract frames from GIF and WebP animated images, or pages from TIFFs.

* Multiple list view modes. Display the indexed files as an easy to scroll list with or without image file details, or as thumbnails list.

* The thumbnails list comes with three predefined aspect ratios: square, wide or tall. Easy to adjust their size: +/- keys.

* Adaptive multi-threaded thumbnails caching to sizes ranging from 600 pixels to 125 pixels. On very fast PCs, no caching occurs.

* Files can automatically be selected by strings, or the ones already seen, favourited, and other options.

* Files list map. A quick view, at a glance, of the files list, highlighting selected files.

* Sort images by histogram data points, such as the average or median point, resolution, aspect ratio.
- by their image properties: resolution, aspect ratio, width, height and so on
- by file properties: size, name, date, et cetera 

* Option to keep a record of seen images and have these skipped during slideshows or erased from the index list. QPV can also generate statistics and charts based on the image viewing habits.

* Image and folders favourites lists; easy to manage. The list can be very big, up to 950100 images.

* Multi-rename. Rename multiple files with easy to use patterns. Users can add a prefix and/or suffix to file names, or to count them, or search and replace strings in file names, and more.

* File statistics panel with categories for: file sizes, file types, modified dates, image size, image histogram data points and much more.

* Identify image duplicates by user chosen image properties, histogram data points or image content similarity. Multiple algorithms are available to choose from.

* Index filters: based on text strings or file and image properties.

* Dedicated panel to automatically identify keywords in file names and folder paths, and option to filter the list based on any identified keyword.

* Copy files from Explorer and paste in Quick Picto Viewer, or from QPV to Explorer.

* Copy file names or folder paths as text to clipboard.

* Quick Picto Viewer has its own slideshow formats to store the list of folders and cache files lists: plain-text and SQLite database.

* Ability to selectively refresh the cached files list from selected folders.

* Search and replace in the index, enabling users to correct potentially broken files lists.

* Very fast loading of cached or not cached lists of files. Tested with 900100 images and it loads in 10 seconds on my system.

* Support for drag and drop of folders or files on the QPV window.

* Perform JPEG lossless operations in batch: flip or crop images.

* Perform actions on image files: resize, rotate [at any degree], crop, change/adjust colors, rename, convert to different file formats, rename, delete, copy or move.

* Batch processing. You can apply any of the previously mentioned action or operation on multiple files at once.


GENERAL / USER INTERFACE:
===========================
